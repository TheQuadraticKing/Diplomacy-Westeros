# hello-world
This is my first repository and me learning about GitHub

I am aware that this is drastically too late for me to start using GitHub as I've already programmed a lot and haven't saved any of it in a reasonable place. I've known about GitHub for a while, but it just looks intimidating and confusing so now, at 11:21pm on a Tuesday, I am going to start a GitHub and learn some basics
