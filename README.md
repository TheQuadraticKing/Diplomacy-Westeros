#Diplomacy-Westeros

This will be the game Diplomacy, but instead of pre-WWI, this should be pre-Blackfyre Rebellion

I, Xavier Stevens, am going to be the head of this project. Since this is a previously established board game, the rules are already in place, but they are quite a bit more complicated than something like Candyland or even Risk. The idea of making Diplomacy with the map of Westeros isn't completely original, but I feel I can do it better than the few that have attempted.

I am aware that since this project uses copyrighted assets, there shouldn't be a chance for me to attempt to monetize it, and even putting it up on the internet could, possiblly, get it taken down but having tried it is worth it for me.

The coding will primarily be done in C# via Visual Studio and will need me to have knowledge of SVG's, Audio input and output for player to player communication which means servers. Some database stuff will be important as well, so maybe some SQL.
