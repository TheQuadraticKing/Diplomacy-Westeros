	3b.	In the year 182AC,a rebellious uprising was in the works against Daeron II Targaryan by his own
		bastard brother Daemon Waters, legitamized by the king to become Daemon Blackfyre.
		Daeron II Targaryan is a cunning and intelligent king with the original right to the Iron Throne,
		while Daemon Blackfyre had only adopted the right to the throne after being legitimized by king
		Aegon IV Targaryan on his deathbed. Are you with or against the rebellion? Do you think neither
		should have right to the Iron Throne? Fight for your King!
